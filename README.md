# Readable

It's a very simple implementation of a forum using react and redux, where a user can create new posts, comment on a post,vote posts and comments. 

## Quick Start

To run the application is necesary to run the [backend service](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/next/README.md) first. 

Then start the react app. 

```
npm install
npm start
```  

## External Packages

The most important packages besides react and redux: 

* [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) - to create a modern look and feel. 
* [moment](https://momentjs.com/) - to show a readable date.
* [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - to sort lists.
* [uuid](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid) - to create unique Ids.
